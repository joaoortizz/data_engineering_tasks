6 - Assuming that you have a query that runs very slowly, what are the steps that you would perform in order to identify the cause?

Answer:
    For PostgreSQL, we can use EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify the query plan and understand better what the query really does.
    Sometimes, the slowly is occurring because of the order of the arguments and this method can help identify.
    We can also understand if this table has any index that the query is using or not. Case not, we can create a new index.
    Other way to deal with this problem is partitioning the table. But this strategy has some side effects, so it depends on a deep study of all queries that uses the table.
