6 - Assuming that you have a query that runs very slowly, what are the steps that you would perform in order to identify the cause?

Answer:
To identify the cause of the query that runs very slowly, I would follow this steps:
1 - Identify the specific query that is running slowly.
2 - Check the query's execution plan to see which parts of the query are taking the most time to run (In PostgreSQL, using EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE).
3 - Look for any potential issues with the query, such as missing indexes or inefficient join conditions.
4 - Check the system's overall performance to see if there are any other factors that could be affecting the query's speed, such as high CPU or memory usage.
5 - If the query is running on a database server, check the server's performance to see if there are any issues that could be impacting the query's speed. If the query is running on a web server, check the server's performance and look for any potential issues that could be impacting the query's speed, such as high network latency or a large number of concurrent requests.
